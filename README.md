# Gradle Example
Simple example using Gradle, along with dependencies!

Check out the first project here: https://github.com/building-with-bukkit/gradle-example

# Let's use a dependency

In this example we are using vault: https://github.com/MilkBowl/VaultAPI

In their README we can see that the maven url is `http://nexus.hc.to/content/repositories/pub_releases`

So we add that to our build.gradle like so:

```groovy
	maven { url "http://nexus.hc.to/content/repositories/pub_releases" }
```

That should be in the repositories. 

We can also see the group is `net.milkbowl.vault`, the name is `VaultAPI`, and the version is `1.6`

So we can add that to our build.gradle like so:

```groovy
	compileOnly group: "net.milkbowl.vault", name: "VaultAPI", version: "1.6";
```

That should be in the dependencies.

Take a look at build.gradle to see how we have done it!

# Structure
The following files are generated by gradle:

```bash
├── LICENSE # The LICENSE file is optional, but you should include a license with your project!
├── README.md # This is the file you are reading right now!
├── build.gradle # This is where you can modify the build script.
├── gradle # This folder has the gradle wrapper files, don't modify it. It allows using gradle without installing it.
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew # Launches gradle wrapper on linux, don't modify it. It allows using gradle without installing it.
├── gradlew.bat # Launches gradle wrapper on windows, don't modify it. It allows using gradle without installing it.
├── settings.gradle # Gradle settings. Take a peek! 
└── src # Your main sources directory
    └── main
        ├── java # Put your main package and java code here.
        └── resources # Put files you want to be copied into the jar here (like plugin.yml).
 ```
 
# Importing into your IDE
 
After you download a copy of the project you will have to let your IDE know that it is a gradle project! 

## Eclipse

Go to File -> Import -> Gradle -> Existing Gradle Project

If you change the directory from `gradle-example` remember to update it in your `settings.gradle` file before you import!

## IntelliJ

You should also be able to import the project as a Gradle project. 

Instructions coming soon.
